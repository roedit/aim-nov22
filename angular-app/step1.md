## Dependencies
We are starting a fresh development environment with all the dependencies installed:
- ubuntu
- node 
- angular

## Development server
Once all the dependencies have been installed, the terminal should show the fallowing message:
```
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **


âœ” Compiled successfully.
```
The application is now available at: {{TRAFFIC_HOST1_4200}}/


This tutorial contains source code for an angular app that will display a list of cats.

In the terminal type the following commands as you go through the steps. You can also just click the *black areas* and the corresponding commands will be run in the Terminal window to the right.
