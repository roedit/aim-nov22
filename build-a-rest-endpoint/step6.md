# Optional: create a new API endpoint

Create a new endpoint, of your choosing!

Come up with your own idea, or try one of these suggestions:

1. Add new cat - i.e. accept details for a new cat to add to the list called *allCats*
2. Filter cats - e.g. by age or breed, or both
3. Sort cats - e.g. by age or breed, or both
4. Forget cats, and create a new endpoint that applies some sort of mathematical function. E.g. take two operands to multiply together, returning the result
5. A new endpoint to return the current time and date for display on the website. How would you test this?

## Notes
* You will need to either create a new Resource class file, or modify *CatResource.java*.
* To see how to accept parameters, have a look at UserResource.java where it uses "@RequestParam"
* You can add a new file by right-clicking on a directory/folder in the left-hand panel of the code editor.
* Test your endpoint using a GET request from your web browser. Or write a Junit test!
